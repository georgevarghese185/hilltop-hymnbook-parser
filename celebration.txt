Safely home by Thy good grace.

Wand'ring from the fold of God;

Bo't me with His precious blood.

Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, O take and seal it;
Seal it for Thy courts above.

Song 151. A Mighty Fortress Is Our God

V1. A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe —
His craft and pow'r are great,
And armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

V2. Did we in our own strength confide,
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right man on our side,
The man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He —
Lord Sabaoth His Name,
From age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.

V3. And tho' this world with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph thro' us.
The prince of darkness grim,
We tremble not for him —
His rage we can endure,
For lo, his doom is sure:
One little word shall fell him.

V4. That word above all earthly pow'rs,
No thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Thro' Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go,
This mortal life also —
The body they may kill;
God's truth abideth still:
His kingdom is forever.

Song 156. THE LOVE OF GOD

The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star, 
And reaches to the lowest hell;
The guilty pair, bowed down with care, 
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled, 
And pardoned from his sin.

C.  
O love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure--
The saints' and angels' song!

When years of time shall pass away
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall, 
When men who here refuse to pray, 
On rocks and hills and mountains call, 
God's love so sure shall still endure, 
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race--
The saints' and angels' song. (Refrain)

Could we with ink the ocean fill
And were the skies of parchment made, 
Were every stalk on earth a quill
And every man a scribe by trade, 
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole, 
Tho' stretched from sky to sky. (Refrain)

And every man a scribe by trade,

From our fears and sins release us, 
Let us find our rest in Thee.
Israel's Strength and Consolation, 
Hope of all the earth Thou art;
Dear Desire of every nation, 
Joy of every longing heart.

Born Thy people to deliver, 
Born a child and yet a King, 
Born to reign in us forever, 
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.
By Thine own eternal Spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone;
By Thine all sufficient merit, 
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.

How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love.
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth;
And praises sing to God, the King,
And peace to men on earth.

V3. How silently, how silently
The wondrous Gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heav'n.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

V4. O holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend on us, we pray.
Cast out our sin, and enter in;
Be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell.
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord, Emmanuel.

Song 251. It Came Upon the Midnight Clear

V1. It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold;
"Peace on the earth, good will to men,
From heaven's all-gracious King!"
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

V2. Still thro' the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heav'nly music floats
O'er all the weary world;
Above its sad and lowly plains
they bend on hov'ring wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

V3. And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing:
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.

V4. For lo! the days are hast'ning on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing.

Glories stream from heaven afar;
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia.
Christ the Savior is born!
Christ the Savior is born!

Wondrous star, lend thy light.
With the angels let us sing
Alleluia to our King.
Christ the Savior is born!
Christ the Savior is born!

Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth,
Jesus Lord at Thy birth.

Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.

And reign in us forever.

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;

On a cold winter’s night that was so deep.

Born is the King of Israel.

Shining in the east, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,

To seek for a King was their intent,

And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay. [Refrain]

And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense. [Refrain]

Sing praises to our heav'nly Lord,
That hath made heav'n and earth of naught,
And with His blood mankind hath bought. [Refrain]

Made higher than all in heaven;

Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good-will to men.

The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along th'unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men.

"For hate is strong, and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men."

"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
With peace on earth, good-will to men."

The world revolved from night to day–
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.

In all our trials born to be our Friend.
He knows our need — to our weakness is no stranger.
Behold your King, before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King, before Him lowly bend!

His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother,
And in His name all oppression shall cease.

Song 286. Once in Royal David's City

Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed:
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little Child.

Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall.
With the poor, and mean, and lowly
Lived on earth, our Savior holy.

V3. Jesus is our childhood's pattern;
Day by day like us He grew.
He was little, weak, and helpless;
Tears and smiles like us He knew.
And He feeleth for our sadness,
And He shareth in our gladness.

V4. And our eyes at last shall see Him,
Thro' His own redeeming love;
For that Child so dear and gentle
Is the Lord in heav'n above.
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone.

Gathered 'round Your table on this holy eve
Viewing Bethlehem's stable we rejoice and grieve
Joy to see You lying in Your manger bed
Weep to see You dying in our sinful stead

Prince of Glory gracing Heav'n ere time began
Now for us embracing death as Son of Man
By Your birth so lowly by Your love so true
By Your cross most holy Lord we worship You

Bethlehem's Incarnation Calvary's bitter cross
Wrought for us salvation by Your pain and loss
Now we fall before You in this holy place
Prostrate we adore You for Your gift of grace

With profoundest wonder we Your body take
Laid in manger yonder broken for our sake
Hushed in adoration we approach the cup
Bethlehem's pure oblation freely offered up

Christmas Babe so tender Lamb who bore our blame
How shall sinners render praises due Your name
Do Your own good pleasure in the lives we bring

Following yonder star.

C. 
O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect light.

V2. Born a King on Bethlehem’s plain;
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign. [Refrain]

V3. Frankincense to offer have I;
Incense owns a Deity nigh.
Prayer and praising, all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high. [Refrain]

V4. Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom -
Sorr'wing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb. [Refrain]

V5. Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice;
Alleluia, alleluia!
Earth to heav'n replies. [Refrain]

Song 289. ADORATION

V1. Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness!
Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim.
With gold of obedience and incense of lowliness, 
Kneel and adore Him--the Lord is His name.

V2. Fear not to enter His presence in poverty
Bearing no gifts to present as your own.
Bring truth in its beauty and love in its purity--
These are the offerings to lay at His throne.

Song 290. As with Gladness Men of Old

V1. As with gladness men of old
Did the guiding star behold;
As with joy they hailed its light,
Leading onward, beaming bright;
So, most gracious Lord, may we
Evermore be led to Thee.

V2. As with joyful steps they sped,
To that lowly manger bed;
There to bend the knee before
Him whom heav'n and earth adore;
So, may we with willing feet
Ever seek the mercy seat.

V3. As they offered gifts most rare
At that manger rude and bare,
So may we with holy joy,
Pure and free from sin's alloy,
All our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee, our heav'nly King.

V4. Holy Jesus, every day
Keep us in the narrow way;
And, when earthly things are past,
Bring our ransomed souls at last
Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

Song 291. O Sing a Song of Bethlehem

V1. O sing a song of Bethlehem,
Of shepherds watching there,
And of the news that came to them
From angels in the air.
The light that shone on Bethlehem
Fills all the world today;
Of Jesus' birth and peace on earth
The angels sing alway.

V2. O sing a song of Nazareth,
Of sunny days of joy.
O sing of fragrant flowers' breath,
And of the sinless Boy;
For now the flowers on Nazareth
In every heart may grow;
Now spreads the fame of His dear name
On all the winds that blow.

V3. O sing a song of Galilee,
Of lake and woods and hill,
Of Him who walked upon the sea
And bade its waves be still:
For tho' like waves on Galilee,
Dark seas of trouble roll,
When faith has heard the Master's word,
Falls peace upon the soul.

V4. O sing a song of Calvary,
Its glory and dismay;
Of Him who hung upon the tree
And took our sins away:
For He who died on Calvary
Is risen from the grave,
And Christ, our Lord, by heav'n adored,
Is mighty now to save.

Song 292. Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne

V1. Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem's home was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity.
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus -
There is room in my heart for Thee!

V2. Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
But of lowly birth didst Thou come to earth,
And in great humility.
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus -
There is room in my heart for Thee!

V3. The foxes found rest and the birds their nest
In the shade of the forest tree;
But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee.
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus -
There is room in my heart for Thee!

V4. Thou camest, O Lord, with the living word
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn and with crown of thorn
They bore Thee to Calvary.
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus -
There is room in my heart for Thee!

V5. When the heav'ns shall ring and the angels sing,
At Thy coming to victory,
Let Thy voice call me home, saying "Yet there is room -
There is room at My side for thee."
My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
When Thou comest and callest for me!

Song 293. Praise the One Who Breaks the Darkness

V1. Praise the One who breaks the darkness
With a liberating light;
Praise the One who frees the pris'ners,
Turning blindness into sight.
Praise the One who preached the gospel,
Healing every dread disease,
Calming storms and feeding thousands
With the very bread of peace.

V2. Praise the One who blessed the children
With a strong yet gentle word;
Praise the One who drove out demons
With a piercing two-edged sword.
Praise the One who brings cool water
To the desert's burning sand;
From this well comes living water
Quenching thirst in every land.

V3. Praise the one true love incarnate:
Christ, who suffered in our place;
Jesus died and rose for many
That we may know God by grace.
Let us sing for joy and gladness,
Seeing what our God has done.
Praise the one redeeming glory;
Praise the One who makes us one.

Song 294. One Day

V1. One day when heaven Was filled with His praises,
One day when sin was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin,
Dwelt among men - my example is He!

C. 
Living, He loved me; 
Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever;
One day He's coming - O glorious day!

V2. One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins - my Redeemer is He! [Refrain]

V3. One day they left Him alone in the garden,
One day He rested, from suffering free;
Angels came down o'er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless - my Savior is He! [Refrain]

V4. One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled away from the door;
Then He arose - over death He had conquered,
Now is ascended, my Lord evermore! [Refrain]

One day the skies with His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Savior - this Jesus is mine! [Refrain]

Write on my heart every word.

Sang as they welcomed His birth:
"Glory to God in the highest!
Peace and good tidings to earth."

C. 
Tell me the story of Jesus;
Write on my heart every word.
Tell me the story most precious,
Sweetest that ever was heard.

V2. Fasting alone in the desert,
Tell of the days that are past,
How for our sins He was tempted,
Yet was triumphant at last.
Tell of the years of His labor;
Tell of the sorrow He bore.
He was despised and afflicted,
Homeless, rejected, and poor. [Refrain]

V3. Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,
Writhing in anguish and pain;
Tell of the grave where they laid Him.
Tell how He liveth again.
Love in that story so tender,
Clearer than ever I see.
Stay, let me weep while you whisper,
Love paid the ransom for me. [Refrain]

Song 297. Hosanna, Loud Hosanna

V1. "Hosanna, loud hosanna,"
The little children sang;
Thro' pillared court and temple
The lovely anthem rang;
To Jesus, who had blessed them
Close folded to His breast,
The children sang their praises,
The simplest and the best.

V2. From Olivet they followed
'Mid an exultant crowd,
The victor palm branch waving
And chanting clear and loud;
The Lord of earth and heaven
Rode on in lowly state,
Nor scorned that little children
Should on His bidding wait.

V3. "Hosanna in the highest!"
That ancient song we sing,
For Christ is our Redeemer,
The Lord of heav'n, our King;
O may we ever praise Him
With heart and life and voice,
And in His blissful presence
Eternally rejoice!

My past with its sin and stain
My guilt and despair
Jesus took on Him there
And Calvary covers it all

That the world can impart
Was the message that came to my heart
How that Jesus alone
For my sin did atone

And the thorns that He wore
Told His mercy and love evermore
And my heart bowed in shame
As I called on His name
And Calvary covers it all

When I looked on the face
Of this Jesus my crucified Lord
My redemption complete
I then found at His feet
And Calvary covers it all

That my soul by Him bought
Shall be His in the glory on high
Where with gladness and song
I'll be one of the throng
And Calvary covers it all

When I was sinking down, sinking down,
When I was sinking down
Beneath God's righteous frown,
Christ laid aside His crown for my soul, for my soul,
Christ laid aside His crown for my soul.

How does that visage languish
Which once was bright as morn!

V2. What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered
Was all for sinners' gain:
Mine, mine was the transgression,
But Thine the deadly pain.
Lo, here I fall, my Savior;
'Tis I deserve Thy place.
Look on me with Thy favor;
Assist me with Thy grace.

V3. What language shall I borrow
To thank Thee, dearest Friend,
For this, Thy dying sorrow,
Thy pity without end?
O make me Thine forever;
And, should I fainting be,
Lord, let me never, never
Outlive my love to Thee.

There are things as we travel
This earth's shifting sands
That transcend all the reason of man
But the things that matter
The most in this world
They can never be held in our hand

I'll believe whatever the cost
And when time has surrendered
And earth is no more
I'll still cling to that old rugged cross

I believe that the Christ
Who was slain on that cross
Has the power to change lives today
For He changed me completely
A new life is mine
That is why by the cross I will stay (Chorus)

I believe that this life
With its great mysteries
Surely someday will come to an end
But faith will conquer
The darkness and death
And will lead me at last to my Friend (Chorus)

Rest beyond the river.

With its shadows o'er me. [Refrain]

Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river. [Refrain]

Song 320. Beneath the Cross of Jesus

V1. Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand;
The shadow of a mighty rock
Within a weary land,
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way
From the burning of the noontide heat
And the burden of the day.

V2. There lies beneath its shadow,
But on the farther side,
The darkness of an awful grave
That gapes both deep and wide;
And there between us stands the cross,
Two arms outstretched to save,
Like a watch-man set to guard the way
From that eternal grave.

V3. Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me.
And from my smitten heart, with tears,
These wonders I confess:
The wonder of His glorious love
And my unworthiness.

V4. I take, O cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self - my only shame,
My glory - all the cross.

Song 321. When I Survey the Wondrous Cross

On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most -
I sacrifice them to His blood.

V3. See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

V4. Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

C. 
At the cross, at the cross,
where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away.
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!

V2. Was it for crimes that I have done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree! [Refrain]

V3. Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut his glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man, the creature's sin. [Refrain]

V4. Thus might I hide my blushing face
While Calv'ry's cross appears,
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt mine eyes to tears. [Refrain]

V5. But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe.
Here, Lord, I give myself away;
'Tis all that I can do. [Refrain]

Why should He love me so?

Nothing withholding my sin to efface;

Walked Christ, my Savior, weary and worn;
Facing for sinners death on the cross,

Blessed Redeemer! Precious Redeemer!
Seems I now see Him on Calvary’s tree;
Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading,
Blind and unheeding, dying for me!

E’en while His lifeblood flowed fast away.
Praying for sinners while in such woe,
No one but Jesus ever loved so! [Refrain]

How can my praises ever find end?
Thro' years unnumbered on heaven’s shore,
My tongue shall praise Him forevermore. [Refrain]

The emblem of suff'ring and shame;

For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down.
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it someday for a crown.

V2. O the old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary. [Refrain]

V3. In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;
For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me. [Refrain]

V4. To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear.
Then He’ll call me someday to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I’ll share. [Refrain]

Tow'ring o'er the wrecks of time.

Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
Never shall the cross forsake me.

Light and love upon my way,
From the cross, the radiance streaming
Adds more luster to the day.

By the cross are sanctified.

Joys that through all time abide.

Drawn from Immanuel's veins;

Lose all their guilty stains.

That fountain in his day,

Wash all my sins away.

Shall never lose its pow'r,
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved, to sin no more:

Be saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved to sin no more.

V4. E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die:
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

V5. When this poor lisping, stamm'ring tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Then in a nobler, sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save:
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save,
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save;
Then in a nobler, sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save.

Let me hide myself in Thee;

From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.

In my hand no price I bring;
Simply to Thy cross I cling.

When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.

Song 353. VICTORY IN JESUS

I heard an old old story
How a Savior came from glory
How He gave His life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me
I heard about His groaning
Of His precious blood's atoning
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory

C. O victory in Jesus
My Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

I heard about His healing
Of His cleansing pow'r revealing
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see
And then I cried dear Jesus
Come and heal my broken spirit
And somehow Jesus came and brought
To me the victory Chorus

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory
And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea
About the angels singing
And the old redemption story
And some sweet day I'll sing up there
The song of victory Chorus

Song 354. I CANNOT TELL

V1. I cannot tell why He the King of heaven
Should leave the peace of all eternity
Why God Himself should lay aside His splendor
To leave the Father's side and come to me
But this I know
Our silence filled with singing
And all our darkness fled from heaven's light
When Christ the Lord so human yet so holy
In love was born a Child for me that holy night

V2. I cannot tell why He the joy of heaven
Should give Himself to suffer for my sin
Why holy God should love me in my shamefulness
Why He should die to draw my soul to Him
But this I know
That Christ the Lord is risen
And praise His name
He's risen now in me
Because He lives I'll rise to life eternal
He took my guilty heart and I'm forever free

V3. I cannot tell when He will rule the nations
How He will claim His loved ones as His own
And who can tell the holy jubilation
When all His children gather 'round His throne
But this I know
All flesh will see His glory
And skies will burst as all creation sings
The Son will rise on one eternal morning
When Christ the Savior of the world
Is Lord and King

There's a kindness in His justice
Which is more than liberty.

V2. There is welcome for the sinner
And more graces for the good;
There is mercy with the Savior;
There is healing in His blood.

V3. For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of man's mind;
And the heart of the Eternal
Is most wonderfully kind.

V4. If our love were but more simple,
We should take Him at His word;
And our lives would be illumined
By the presence of our Lord.

I'll fight life's final war with pain
And then as death gives way to vict'ry

His the victory alone.
Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion
Thunder like a mighty flood:

Has redeemed us by His blood."

Are we left in sorrow now.

Faith believes, nor questions how.
Tho' the clouds from sight received Him
When the forty days were o'er,
Shall our hearts forget His promise:
"I am with you evermore"?

You on earth our food and stay!
Alleluia! here the sinful
Flee to You from day to day.

Where the songs of all the sinless
Sweep across the crystal sea.

V1. God of grace and God of glory,
On Thy people pour Thy pow'r.
Crown Thine ancient Church’s story;
Bring her bud to glorious flow'r.
Grant us wisdom; grant us courage,
For the facing of this hour,
For the facing of this hour.

Scorn the Christ, assail His ways!
From the fears that long have bound us,
Free our hearts to faith and praise.
Grant us wisdom; grant us courage,
For the living of these days,
For the living of these days.

Bend our pride to Thy control.
Shame our wanton, selfish gladness,
Rich in things and poor in soul.
Grant us wisdom; grant us courage,
Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal,
Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal.

V4. Set our feet on lofty places;
Gird our lives that they may be
Armored with all Christ-like graces
In the fight to set men free.
Grant us wisdom; grant us courage
That we fail not man nor Thee,
That we fail not man nor Thee.

Upward for aye on wings like a dove,
Jesus, I come to Thee.

Jesus I come; Jesus I come;
Into the joy and light of Thy home,
Jesus, I come to Thee.
Out of the depths of ruin untold,
Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,
Jesus, I come to Thee.

To Calvary. [Refrain]

Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary. [Refrain]

'Til the storm passes over
'Til the thunder sounds no more
'Til the clouds roll forever from the sky
Hold me fast let me stand
In the hollow of Thy hand
Keep me safe 'til the storm passes by

Have I oft hid my face
While the storms howl above me
And there's no hiding place
'Mid the crash of the thunder
Precious Lord hear my cry
Keep me safe 'til the storm passes by

V2. Many times Satan whispered
There is no use to try
For there's no end of sorrow
There's no hope by and by
But I know Thou art with me
And tomorrow I'll rise
Where the storms never darken the skies

V3. When the long night has ended
And the storms come no more
Let me stand in Thy presence
On that bright peaceful shore
In that land where the tempest never comes
Lord may I dwell with Thee
When the storm passes by

All to leave and follow Thee;

All I've sought, and hoped and known;
Yet how rich is my condition,
God and heav'n are still my own!

They have left my Savior, too.
Human hearts and looks deceive me;
Thou art not, like man, untrue.
And while Thou shalt smile upon me,
God of wisdom, love and might,
Foes may hate and friends may shun me.
Show Thy face and all is bright.

V3. Hasten on from grace to glory,
Armed by faith and winged by prayer;
Heav'n's eternal days before me,
God's own hand shall guide thee there.
Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
Swift shall pass my pilgrim days;
Hope shall change to glad fruition;
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.

The law of love I gladly will obey.

I've been so loved that I'll risk loving, too. 
I know how fear builds walls instead of bridges; 
I dare to see another's point of view. 
And when relationships demand commitment, 
Then I'll be there to care and follow through.

V3.Your kingdom come around and through and in me, 
Your power and glory- let them shine through me. 
Your Hallowed Name, O may I bear with honor, 
And may Your living Kingdom come in me. 
The Bread of Life, O may I share with honor, 
And may You feed a hungry world through me.

Where there is blindness we will pray for sight
Where there is darkness we will shine His light
Where there is sadness we will bear their grief
To the millions crying for release
We will be His instruments of peace. Chorus

Forgive our foolish ways!
Reclothe us in our rightful mind;
In purer lives Thy service find,
In deeper rev'rence, praise.

Beside the Syrian sea,
The gracious calling of the Lord,
Let us, like them, without a word,
Rise up and follow Thee.

Till all our strivings cease.
Take from our souls the strain and stress,
And let our ordered lives confess
The beauty of Thy peace.

Thy coolness and Thy balm.
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
Speak thro' the earthquake, wind, and fire,
O still small voice of calm!

That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known;
In seasons of distress and grief
My soul has often found relief
And oft escaped the tempter's snare
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless:
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His Word, and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.

Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away.
Change and decay in all around I see;

What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who, like Thyself, my Guide and Stay can be?
Thro' cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.

Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still if Thou abide with me.

V5. Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine thro' the gloom and point me to the skies.
Heav'n's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee.
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now, in the paths of sin,
Some wand’rer whom I should seek.

Tho' dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I’ll say what you want me to say. [Refrain]

In earth’s harvest fields so wide
Where I may labor thro' life’s short day

I’ll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I’ll be what You want me to be. [Refrain]

By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side.
Savior, we are Thine.

With Thy love our beings fill:

In the cold night of sin I did roam
When Jesus the kind Shepherd found me
And now I am on my way home

He guards me each step of the way (Chorus)

My Savior will walk with me there
And safely His great hand will lead me
To the mansions He's gone to prepare (Chorus)

So to trust Your promises, O Lord,

One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
Till I reach the Promised Land.

Song 733. Once to Every Man and Nation

V1. Once to every man and nation
Comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of truth with falsehood,
For the good or evil side;
Some great cause, some great decision,
Off'ring each the bloom or blight,
And the choice goes by forever
'Twixt that darkness and that light.

V2. Then to side with truth is noble,
When we share her wretched crust,
Ere her cause bring fame and profit,
And 'tis prosp'rous to be just;
Then it is the brave man chooses
While the coward stands aside,
Till the multitude make virtue
Of the faith they had denied.

V3. By the light of burning martyrs,
Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track;
Toiling up new Calv'ries ever
With the cross that turns not back.
New occasions teach new duties;
Ancient values test our youth.
They must upward still and onward,
Who would keep abreast of truth.

V4. Tho' the cause of evil prosper,
Yet the truth alone is strong;
Tho' her portion be the scaffold,
And upon the throne be wrong,
Yet that scaffold sways the future,
And, behind the dim unknown,
Standeth God, within the shadow,
Keeping watch above His own.

I am His and He is mine.
Since I know, as now I know,
I am His and He is mine.

Cannot now disturb my rest.
Closed in everlasting arms,
Pillowed on the loving breast -

Doubt and care and self resign
While He whispers in my ear,
I am His and He is mine.
While He whispers in my ear,
I am His and He is mine.

Who the Lord and me shall part?
Ah, with what a rest of bliss
Christ can fill the loving heart!

I am His and He is mine.
But while God and I shall be,
I am His and He is mine.

We should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning

Brought it back victorious
When from death He passed.

There let Him remove
All that is not holy,
All that is not true.
Crown Him as your captain
In temptation's hour;
Let His will enfold you
In its light and pow'r.

Shall return again
In His Father's glory,
O'er the earth to reign;
For the day is coming
When each knee shall bow,
And our hearts confess Him
King of Glory now.

May take its toll
Of misery and strife
The soul of man
Is like a waiting falcon
When it's released
It's destined for the skies

Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving
To God our Creator triumphantly raise, 
Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us, 
By guiding us on to the end of our days.
God's banners are o'er us, Pure light goes before us, 
A pillar of fire shining forth in the night, 
Til shadows have vanished, all fearfulness banished, 
As forward we travel from light into light.

By law God enforces. The stars in their courses, 
The sun in its orbit, obediently shine;
The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains, 
The deeps of the ocean proclaim God divine, 
We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing,

Song 795. WE ARE SO BLESSED

V1. We are so blessed
By the gifts from Your hand
I just can't understand
Why You've loved us so much
We are so blessed
We just can't find a way
Or the words that can say
Thank You Lord for Your touch

Chorus 1
When we're empty You fill us
'Til we overflow
When we're hungry You feed us
And cause us to know
We are so blessed
Take what we have to bring
Take it all ev'rything
Lord we love You so much

Song 796. IN THANKSGIVING, LET US PRAISE HIM

C. In thanksgiving, let us praise Him;
In thanksgiving, let us sing
Songs of praise and adoration
To our gracious Lord and King.

V1. From the first bright light of morning
To the last warm glow of dusk;
Every breath we take is sacred, 
for it is God's gift to us.

V2. In the season of our plenty, 
In the season of our need;
We will find His grace sufficient, 
We will find His love complete.

V3. Safe within His hand that guides us, 
Hidden in His healing wings;
Day by day His love provides us
Every good and perfect thing.

Song 797. Come, Ye Thankful People, Come

V1. Come, ye thankful people, come;
Raise the song of harvest home;
all is safely gathered in
Ere the winter storms begin.
God, our Maker, doth provide
for our wants to be supplied.
Come to God's own temple, come;
Raise the song of harvest home.

V2. All the world is God's own field,
Fruit unto His praise to yield;
Wheat and tares together sown,
Unto joy or sorrow grown.
First the blade, and then the ear,
Then the full corn shall appear;
Lord of harvest, grant that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.

V3. For the Lord our God shall come,
And shall take His harvest home;
From His field shall in that day
All offenses purge away.
Give His angels charge at last
In the fire the tares to cast,
But the fruitful ears to store
In His garner evermore.

V4. Even so, Lord, quickly come
To Thy final harvest-home;
Gather Thou Thy people in,
Free from sorrow, free from sin.
There forever purified
In Thy presence to abide.
Come, with all Thine angels come;
Raise the glorious harvest home.

Song 799. America the Beautiful

V1. O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!
America! America! 
God shed His grace on thee,
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!

V2. O beautiful for pilgrim feet,
Whose stern, impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness!
America! America! 
God mend thine every flaw,
Confirm thy soul in self-control,
Thy liberty in law!

V3. O beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife,
Who more than self their country loved
And mercy more than life!
America! America! 
May God thy gold refine
Till all success be nobleness,
And every gain divine!

V4. O beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam,
Undimmed by human tears!
America! America! 
God shed His grace on thee,
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!

Song 802. The Star-Spangled Banner

V1. O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

V2. O thus be it ever, when free men shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n rescued land
praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just;
And this be our motto: "In God is our trust!"
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Song 803. IF MY PEOPLE WILL PRAY

If My people, which are called by My name, 
Shall humble themselves, 
shall humble themselves and pray;

If my people which are called by My name, 
Shall seek My face and
turn from their wicked ways;
Then will I hear from heaven, 
Then will I hear from heaven, 
Then will I hear and will forgive, forgive their sin.

If My people, which are called by My name, 
Shall humble themselves, 
shall humble themselves and pray;
I will forgive their sin, I will forgive their sin, 
I will forgive their sin, And heal their land.

If My people, which are called by My name, 
Shall humble themselves, 
shall humble themselves and pray.

Song 804. BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

C.  
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

V2. I have seen Him in the watchfires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.
His day is marching on. Refrain
3 He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on. Refrain

V4. In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, 
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:
As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free;
While God is marching on. Refrain

Song 805. IF MY PEOPLE'S HEARTS ARE HUMBLED

If My people's hearts are humbled
If they pray and seek My face
If they turn away from evil
I will not withhold My grace
I will hear their prayers from heaven
I will pardon every sin
If My people's hearts are humbled
I will surely heal their land

Then My eyes will see their sorrow
Then My ears will hear their plea
If My people's hearts are humbled
I will set their nation free
If My people's hearts are humbled
If they pray and seek My face
If they turn away from evil
I will not withhold My grace

From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

In wisdom guide, with faith and freedom dow'r;

Sweet land of liberty,
Of thee I sing:
Land where my fathers died,
Land of the pilgrims' pride,
From every mountainside
Let freedom ring!

Land of the noble free,
Thy name I love:
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills;
My heart with rapture thrills

And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song:
Let mortal tongues awake,
Let all that breathe partake;
Let rocks their silence break,
The sound prolong.

Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing:
Long may our land be bright
With freedom's holy light;
Protect us by Thy might,
Great God, our King!

Song 808. Eternal Father, Strong to Save

V1. Eternal Father, strong to save,
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,
Who bids the mighty ocean deep–
Its own appointed limits keep:
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.

V2. O Christ, the Lord of  hill and plain
O'er which our traffic runs amain
By mountain pass or valley low;
Wherever, Lord, our brethren go,
Protect them by Thy guarding hand
From every peril on the land.

V3. O Spirit, whom the Father sent
To spread abroad the firmament;
O Wind of heaven, by Thy might
Save all who dare the eagle's flight;
And keep them by Thy watchful care
From  every peril in the air.

V4. O Trinity of love and pow'r,
Our brethren shield in danger's hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect them wheresoe'er they go;
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee
Glad praise from air and land and sea.

Leads forth in beauty all the starry band
Of shining worlds in splendor through the skies,
Our grateful songs before Thy throne arise.

In this free land by Thee our lot is cast;
Be Thou our Ruler, Guardian, Guide and Stay,
Thy Word our law, Thy paths our chosen way.

Be Thy strong arm our ever sure defense;
Thy true religion in our hearts increase,
Thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace.

Lead us from night to never-ending day;
Fill all our lives with love and grace divine;
And glory, laud and praise be ever Thine!

V1. Another year is dawning:
Dear Father, let it be,
In working or in waiting,
Another year with Thee;
Another year of progress,
Another year of praise,
Another year of proving
Thy presence all the days.

V2. Another year of mercies,
Of faithfulness and grace;
Another year of gladness
In the shining of Thy face;
Another year of leaning
Upon Thy loving breast;
Another year of trusting,
Of quiet, happy rest.

V3. Another year of service,
Of witness for Thy love;
Another year of training 
For holier work above;
Another year is dawning:
Dear Father, let it be,
On earth or else in heaven,
Another year for Thee.
